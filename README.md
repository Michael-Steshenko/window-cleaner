# window-cleaner
A place for me to keep a set of tools, configurations and installation instructions for tools that I use for Windows development

## Tools

### Scoop
Scoop is a windows command line package manager, for installation refer: https://scoop.sh/

### MinGit
Git CSM automatically installs git bash and git GUI, which I don't need, instead I use Scoop package manager to install MinGit:  
```scoop install mingit```  
now we can use the git command from command prompt and powershell.

### WSL 2
Windows subsystem for linux  
Just google install instructions

### Windows Terminal
A wrapper for all the CLI that you need in Windows  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started

### PowerToys
Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows 10 experience for greater productivity.
I use this for remapping keyboard shortcuts that windows does not let me remap or disable and for FancyZones - a windows window layout manager.

### AutoHotKey
Automation scripting language for Windows.  
I use it to create custom windows keyboard shorcuts, for example, I use a shortcut to access the Bluetooth devices settings page to quickly switch between bluetooth audio output devices.   
See Bluetooth-Devices.ahk in this repository. (Tested on Windows 11 Preview)

## Configurations

### Setting up enviorment variables in WSL
- Launch your wsl instance.
- $ sudo vim ~/.bashrc
- Enter your password.
- Press i to go into edit mode. Go to the end of the file using arrow key.
- Add your variable as API_KEY=123 at the end of the file. If your variable has spaces, use quotes.Example - API_KEY= 'My Key'
- Press esc key to get out of edit mode.
- Enter :wq and press enter . This will save and close the file.
- $ source ~/.bashrc will load your recent changes into your current shell.

### Disabling windows magnifier
I was unable to disable the win + "+" and win + "-" shortcuts (Windows 11 Preview), even when the shortcut was disabled in windows settings it would get re-enabled when the shorcut was pressed and would open magnifier, but we can disable magnifier itself:
- run Command Prompt (Admin)
- Run the following two commands to change the ownership of the Magnify.exe app and grant full permissions to Administrators. Without this step youâ€™re unable to rename or make any change to the Magnify.exe file.  
```takeown /f C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe```  
```cacls C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe /G administrators:F```  
- Open your File Explorer and go to your system directory: C:\Windows\System32. locate the Magnify.exe file. Right-click on it and rename the filename to Magnify.exe.bak.
