# window-cleaner
A place for me to keep a set of tools, configurations and installation instructions for tools that I use for Windows development

### Scoop
Scoop is a windows command line package manager, for installation refer: https://scoop.sh/

### MinGit
Git CSM automatically installs git bash and git GUI, which I don't need, instead I use Scoop package manager to install MinGit:  
```scoop install mingit```  
now we can use the git command from command prompt and powershell.
